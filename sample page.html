<p>After the first two weeks of March Madness, many brackets have already fallen to shambles.
According to several sources, there are no perfect brackets remaining. Some may assume creating
a perfect bracket is not very difficult. However, the odds of creating a perfect bracket are 1 in 
9.2 quintillion. The odds are low, almost impossibly low. </p>

<p>But, you can greatly increase your odds just by having some basic knowledge of basketball and 
betting; It is unlikely a 2 seed will succeed to a 15 seed, and even more unlikely that a 1 seed
will loose to a 16 seed. Anyways, goodluck in your bracketing endevors, may you be the first to 
create a perfect bracket (in 2025 that is). </p>
