<p> In response to congestion at the 1957 Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, the Maryland State Roads Commission in the 1960s planned a second 
harbor crossing between Hawkins Point and Sollers Point, along with replacing an old drawbridge over Curtis Creek. The Fort McHenry 
Tunnel, opened in 1985 with four tubes, was part of these efforts to manage traffic. However, due to cost overruns and other challenges, 
an alternative plan for a four-lane bridge was approved by the General Assembly in 1971, designed to also accommodate vehicles carrying 
hazardous materials. Construction of this bridge, later named the Francis Scott Key Bridge in honor of the national anthem's author, 
began in 1972 but faced delays and budget issues. </p>
